 ## Final Term Project Proposal Abstract
 ### Novel Game: A strategy card game based on Cellular Automata
 *Conway's Game of Life*, created in 1970 by the mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton that mirrors natural, dynamical discrete systems. Multiplayer variants of *Life* have been created, however they have lacked the key mechanics that make competitive games engaging - strategy and adaptation. This project sets out to refine and limit the choices available to players to create a captivating, highly strategic, competitive, and educational experience. The outcome will be a two-player card game paired with an educational workshop on cellular automata. In the game, players place offensive or defensive *Seed Cards* on the board and score points by having living cells cross the opponent's edge of the board. By limiting the number of cards available to each player and by using a best of three rounds system, hand management will be a central part of the game and this will enable the development of different strategies through hand preservation and gambits. A computer opponent will be created using the *Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm*. The educational workshop will be evaluated through a focus on learnability and utility, enabling the testing of the hypothesis of whether this software is effective in supporting the teaching of cellular automata in schools. Observation and focus groups will be a central part of this evaluation. The project will be implemented in C# using Unity Engine and will be available online as an HTML5 web app.

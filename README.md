 ## Final Term Project Proposal Abstract
 ### Novel Game: A strategy card game based on Cellular Automata
 Conway's Game of Life, created in 1970 by the mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton that uses a two dimensional grid, Moore Neighbourhood calculations, and a numerical rule set to iterate through successive board states. It is a zero-player game, with the focus being on the initial state of the board and the resulting iterations that the starting configuration creates. Multiplayer variants of Life have been created, however they have lacked the key mechanics that make competitive games engaging - strategy and adaptation. This project sets out to refine and limit the choices available to players to create a captivating, highly strategic, competitive, and educational experience. The outcome will be a two-player card game where players place offensive or defensive Seed Cards on the board and score points by having living cells cross the opponent's edge of the board. By limiting the number of cards available to each player and by using a best of three rounds system, hand management will be a central part of the game and this will enable the development of different strategies through hand preservation and gambits. A computer opponent will be created using the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm, and an educational workshop will be incorporated into the game. It will be implemented using Unity Engine and available as an HTML5 web app.

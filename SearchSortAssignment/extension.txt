Extension for Roller Board Exercise

Main functionality
1 -> Choice of Manual or File input
2 -> Linked list
3 -> Updated algorithm

1. Input Choice
-> User is prompted for choice of input
   -> Manual input of Height, Width and Grid (row by row)
   -> File name input as per base exercise
   -> Invalid input options will abort the program with error message
-> Verbose option still available as command line argument to print solutions

2. Linked List
-> Array has been replaced by a linked list
-> Struct now contains pointer to parent and pointer to next member of list
-> If new board is not unique, allocated space is cleared before continuing

3. Updated algorithm
-> Introduced check before adding new board to list
-> Checks if new board's sum of top row is >= than current board's
-> If true, adds to linked list; if false, discards and free's alloc'd space
-> Implemented alongside the unique grid check
-> Runs much faster than original approach
-> Can rapidly solve 6x6, 12 move grid:
